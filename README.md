This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup
1. Head to the [NY Times Dev Portal](https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started) and create an account.
2. Once logged in select Apps from the user-drop down.
3. Click **+ New App** to make a new app.
4. Enter a name and description for the app.
5. Under the APIs section turn on the **Top Stories API**.
6. Create the app.
7. Click on the newly created app and copy the API key to clipboard.
8. In the `.env_sample` file replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your API key.
9. Rename the `.env_sample` file to `.env`.
10. Start the app with the `npm start` command.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
